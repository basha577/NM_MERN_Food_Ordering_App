## üõ† Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### **`npm start`**
- Runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### **`npm test`**
- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- See the section about running tests for more information.

### **`npm run build`**
- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!
- See the section about deployment for more information.

### **`npm run eject`**
- **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!
- If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
- It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them.
- All the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
